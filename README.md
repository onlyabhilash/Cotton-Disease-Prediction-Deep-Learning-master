## Demo

## Overview
This is a simple image classification Flask app trained on the top of Keras API. The trained model (`app/model/model_resnet50.h5`) takes an image (Cotton Leaf or Plant) as an input and predict the class of image from Cotton leaf or plant saying whether leaf or plant deseased or not.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:
1. Training a deep learning model using Keras.
2. Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Set the environment variable on Heroku as mentioned in _STEP 1_ in the __Run__ section. [[Reference](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)]

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.
